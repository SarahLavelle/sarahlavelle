            <strong>What data do I collect?</strong>
            <strong></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            To enable me to conduct my business operations as well as facilitate
            logistics and carry out accounting processes, I will, when necessary,
            collect, use, store and transfer personal information which may include:
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Identity Data:</em> First Name, Last Name
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Contact Data:</em> Billing address, Delivery address, Email address, Telephone
            numbers
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Technical Data:</em> session statistics including approximate geolocation 
            (see Google Analytics entry in Third Party Businesses section below)
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Financial Data:</em> Payment details including bank account number and sort code.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <strong>How I collect your data:</strong>
            <strong></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            I will collect your Data from you directly in the following ways:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-group">
            <li class="fs-6 mx-5">When you communicate with me via email or speak to me in person or on the phone, especially in connection with organizing workshops.</li>
            <li class="fs-6 mx-5">When you contact me via my social media channels.</li>
            <li class="fs-6 mx-5 mb-3">I do <em>not</em> collect personal markers such as name, address, email address or phone number via this website.</li>            
        </ul>
        
        
        <p>
            <strong>Failure to provide personal data</strong>
            <strong></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            If I need to collect your personal data under the terms of a contract I
            have with you and you fail to provide that data when requested, I may not
            be able to perform the contract I have or am trying to enter into with you.
            For example to provide you with goods and services. In this case I may have
            to cancel delivery of a product or service you may have requested from me -
            but I will notify you in this case.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>How I use your data (The lawful basis for the processing)</strong>
            <strong></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Performance of contract</em>
            <u></u>
        </p>
        <p>
            In store / by email / by social media / by phone.
        </p>
        <p>
            This means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance
            of a contract to which you are a party, or to take steps at your request
            before entering into such a contract. For example, to communicate with you,
            to facilitate logistics and to provide payment to or to receive payment
            from you.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Legitimate interest</em>
            <u></u>
        </p>
        <p>
            Via my website - To monitor and improve the quality of my website platform.
        </p>
        <p>
            This means the interest of my business in conducting and managing my
            business to enable me to give you the best possible service / product and
            the most secure experience. I make sure I consider and balance any
            potential impact on you and your rights before I process your personal data
            for my legitimate interest. I will not use your personal data for
            activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless
            we have your consent or are otherwise permitted to by law)
        </p>
        <p>
            I would also use your data when you have given me your consent. This means
            you have opted to receive emails by contacting me directly with an enquiry.

        <p>
            <strong>No fee required – with some exceptions</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise
            any of the other rights). However, I may charge a reasonable admin fee if
            your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively,
            I may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>What I may need from you</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            I may need to request specific information from you to help me confirm your
            identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise
            any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that
            personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive
            it. I may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation
            to your request to speed up my response to you.
        </p>
        <p>
           <strong> Time limit to respond</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            I will try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month.
            Occasionally it may take me longer than a month if your request is
            particularly complex or you have made a number of requests of me. In this
            case, I will notify you and keep you updated on my progress.
